Today, most of us wake up from hearing the ‘ping’ sound of our WhatsApp notification. We connect with our friends on FB or Snapchat, browse through our Instagram feeds every 5 minutes, watch videos on youtube, listen to music on Spotify, search Google with all the questions that pop into our mind and all of it for free! The fact that these sites are free is the problem.

 While these applications give us an overwhelming amount of information at our fingertips, it also exposes surprisingly large amounts of our personal information to the rest of the online world. As the saying goes ‘If the product is free, then you are the product’.
Gone are the days where people used to fight for land and resources. Today, data is the new gold and hundreds of thieves are prowling around you to steal your data. The shreds of our digital identity are being robbed by these tech-giants. Our personal data is loose on the web, and it’s nearly impossible to know who is collecting and mining it. Our data ends up in an oblique, spidery distribution process, and almost all of it is beyond our control. Today data breaches have turned into an inevitable nightmare for all of us

From allegations of election interference to the most recent charges of unauthorized data access against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, brings to light the new infringements on our right to privacy. To a stalker, an open Facebook profile is a dream come true, with all sort of personal details, from current city of residence to phone numbers and photos, all available with a swipe. On Twitter and FB, many users post pictures with their location tagged, letting others know their whereabouts with relative accuracy, thus informing many burglars know that you’re not at home. Google is collecting our sensitive data and tracking all our activities around the web and selling these to third parties without our consent and knowledge. The very fact that these free service provider employees can possibly read our private emails, listen to recorded voicemails and track our every move is unnerving.


There have been reports of an Alexa device recording home conversations and emailing them to a user’s employees. Skype, WhatsApp, Uber, and other services as well are not off the hook either. What they are doing with our call history and our location history are details beyond our imagination. Let us not forget about hackers who are hitting these free services 24/7 trying to get hold of our data. In short, these so-called free apps are not free. They come with a cost. They worth all the information, that we willingly and unwillingly disclose –all our likes and dislikes, our habits and preferences, our search history, our call logs, location trackers, etc.

Our data is our asset and our privacy is our right. As Edward Snowden pointed out “Privacy isn’t about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. And that’s who you are. Privacy is the right to the self. Privacy is what gives you the ability to share with the world who you are on your own terms. Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”
Now you the irony of the so-called free apps, don’t you? It is time to take action and decide whether we want to live in a world where everything that we say, everything we do, everyone we talk to, all that we think is recorded. We should not let unwanted intruders invade our rights

Most of us feel like we have “lost control” over how our data is collected and shared and it leads many people to throw their hands in the air and accept defeat to those Goliaths of the internet world. There tools that we can use to some extent to enjoy the fruit of the internet without sacrificing our online privacy. If we do our homework right, the reward will be worth it — we would be able to breathe with ease knowing that our sensitive data is secure from prying malicious eyes who are constantly prowling around us
