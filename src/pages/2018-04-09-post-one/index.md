‘A world without money’: this is what the cashless economy aims for. It is a goal that many countries are striving for. India too has taken her first steps in this direction. A quick glimpse into the UPI apps on our smartphones, like paytm and google pay, strengthens the argument that our country has already started to move towards a cashless economy.

From the pettiest vegetable vendors to the opulent five-star hotel has a ‘paytm accepted here’ sign. Gone are the days where people used to stuff their purses with lots of cash. Today, it is our credit/debit cards and the UPI apps on our phones, that dominates our transcations. People have also started investing in digital cryptocurrencies like bitcoins and are much awaiting for Facebook’s libracoin. All these are positive steps to a cashless India.

The factors that inspire people to go cashless are its ease of payment and 24x7 availability. With the advent of digital modes, one can avoid queue for ATMs, transact 24*7 and save time. There are reports that suggest that going cashless would decrease errors and crimes. In a cashless economy, the risk of money getting stolen or lost is minimal. Fostering cashless societies has also been hailed as a method to deprive terrorists of the most private payment system. The flow of cash is difficult to track, hence it is the driver of the black market and shadow economy. Illegal transactions, black money, smuggling, trafficking, etc thrive due to this lack of monetarization. However, with the advent of a cashless economy, each penny spend by a person would be tracked and this would greatly hamper terrorist activities. Thus going cashless has the potential to curb shadow economy, corruption, terror -financing, human and drug trafficking, etc. Other are a plethora of other reasons, why India should shift to a cashless economy
